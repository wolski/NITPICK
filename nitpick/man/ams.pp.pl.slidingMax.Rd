\title{Apply a local maximum postprocessing filter to a peak list}
\description{
  Implements a local maximum postprocessing filter for peak lists.
}
\usage{
ams.pp.pl.slidingMax(peaks, charge.state.wise = F, n = 3)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{peaks}{peak list (as returned from \code{ams.pp.strap.getPeakList}}
  \item{charge.state.wise}{charge state-wise application of the filter?}
  \item{n}{size of the neighborhood (also called G)}
}
\details{
  FILL ME OUT.
}
\value{
	A peak list, consisting of all local maxima, according to the 
	given parameterization.
